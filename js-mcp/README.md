### MCP Client
- After a lot of research, found a good library to handle MCP clients without writing raw mcp client code
- Library: easy-mcp-use (alternative to mcp-use in python) - https://github.com/dforel/easy-mcp-use
- You can also checkout mastra: https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra to implement mcp clients easily, but thats little bit different and more like an agent framework
